        <h2>MACHINE LEARNING SCIENTIST:</h2>
        <h4>Average Salary:₹10.8 Lakhs.</h4>
        <p>Machine Learning scientists are experts who work under the broad umbrella of Data Science – Artificial Intelligence. They are sophisticated engineers who specialize in Machine Learning. Their primary job responsibility is to design and develop intelligent machines and systems that can perform human-like tasks with minimal human intervention.</p>
        &lt;&gt;
        <h2>DATA SCIENTIST:</h2>
        <h4>Average Salary:₹10.5 Lakhs.</h4>
        <p>Data Scientists are highly expert professionals whose primary aim is to create value out of large and complex datasets. They are data wizards who collect vast volumes of data from disparate sources on a daily basis. After gathering the data, Data Scientists clean, organize and process the data for analysis purposes to uncover the hidden patterns in the data.</p>
        &lt;&gt;
        <h2>CHEMIST:</h2>
        <h4>Average Salary:₹2.5 Lakhs.</h4>
        <p>A chemist can also be regarded as a scientist who studies the characteristics and reactions of chemicals. They examine a variety of chemical substances, both organic and inorganic. They experiment with chemical substances to better understand their behavior, produce new compounds, or improve current ones. Their key responsibilities include doing quality control checks on chemical experiments and providing reports on the test and analysis findings and conclusions.</p>
        &lt;&gt;
        <h2>GEOSCIENTISTS:</h2>
        <h4>Average Salary:₹7.8 Lakhs.</h4>
        <p>Do you prefer to study something closer to home? Geoscientists examine the structure, composition, processes, and physical qualities of the Earth. By understanding more about the Earth, these scientists can better appreciate its history and predict future changes. Geology, geochemistry, geophysics, petroleum geology, seismology, oceanography, paleontology, and engineering geology are all disciplines within the geosciences subject.</p>
        &lt;&gt;
        <h2>ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCHERS:</h2>
        <h4>Average Salary:₹4.7 Lakhs.</h4>
        <p>Do you have a wish to become a weather forecaster? Why not look into climate change? Atmospheric scientists are experts who study the atmosphere to understand better and solve problems ranging from severe storms and air pollution to droughts and climate change impacts. Atmospheric scientists collect temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed. </p>
        &lt;&gt;
        <h2>DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR:</h2>
        <h4>Average Salary: ₹10.5 Lakhs.</h4>
        <p>Database administrators design and build large databases. They set standards for operations, programming, and security of the databases to ensure they perform as intended.</p>
        &lt;&gt;
        <h2>BOTANIST:</h2>
        <h4>Average Salary: ₹5.0 Lakhs.</h4>
        <p>Some scientists focus on plants and study their chemical properties and correlation with other species. As a plant scientist, you research soil erosion, chemical properties or plant medicine. All your studies are aimed at revealing the relationship between plants and animals.</p>
        &lt;&gt;
        <h2>PHYSICIST:</h2>
        <h4>Average Salary: ₹7.0 Lakhs.</h4>
        <p>As a scientist, you can focus on exploring energy, matter and other aspects of physics. Physicists often explore the theoretical aspects or conduct experiments to explain physical phenomena.</p>
